Video: https://youtu.be/QABkof8ygzI

Fetch your props directly from the Database?!?! Adam Wathan showed a simple example of loading props directly from the database: https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1246144545361997829

In this video we'll explore this hook, along with two others for building static pages. Next.js 9.3 came out with 3 new hooks that allow you to fetch data in different ways:

- getServerSideProps: Fetch data server side
- getStaticPaths: Fetch data to generate static pages
- getStaticProps: Fetch data to build a static page
